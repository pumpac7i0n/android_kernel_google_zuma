# Error Statistics
# These statistics are maintained by the kernel driver.

What:		/sys/class/edgetpu/edgetpu-soc/device/firmware_crash_count
Date:		April 2021
Description:
		Count of “unrecoverable” firmware crash events; does not include “non-fatal” crashes
		in non-privileged VII job processing code from which the firmware indicates it can
		recover (that is, it only counts crashes in privileged firmware processing).  (No
		clear action.)

What:		/sys/class/edgetpu/edgetpu-soc/device/watchdog_timeout_count
Date:		April 2021
Description:

		(that is, firmware fails to respond to periodic query by the host kernel) and
		device-side watchdog timeout events sent from firmware (on Hermosa).  (No clear
		action.)
Users:		Edge TPU runtime library (libedgetpu)

# Performance/Usage Statistics
# These stats are gathered from the firmware periodically while the device is powered up, and also
# at mobile power down time (or Hermosa device group disband time).  Reading the sysfs file will
# immediately poll for updated values if the TPU device is currently powered on; if the (mobile)
# device is powered down then the last received value is returned.  Some of these attributes are
# only provided for certain chipsets as noted below.
