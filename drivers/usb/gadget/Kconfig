# USB Gadget support on a system involves
#    (a) a peripheral controller, and
#    (b) the gadget driver using it.
#
# NOTE:  Gadget support ** DOES NOT ** depend on host-side CONFIG_USB !!
#
#  - Host systems (like PCs) need CONFIG_USB (with "A" jacks).
#  - Peripherals (like PDAs) need CONFIG_USB_GADGET (with "B" jacks).
#  - Some systems have both kinds of controllers.
#
# With help from a special transceiver and a "Mini-AB" jack, systems with
# both kinds of controller can also support "USB On-the-Go" (CONFIG_USB_OTG).

	  Microsoft Windows XP bundles the "Remote NDIS" (RNDIS) protocol,
	  and Microsoft provides redistributable binary RNDIS drivers for
	  older versions of Windows.

	  To make MS-Windows work with this, use Documentation/usb/linux.inf
	  as the "driver info file".  For versions of MS-Windows older than
	  XP, you'll need to download drivers from Microsoft's website; a URL
	  is given in comments found in that info file.
